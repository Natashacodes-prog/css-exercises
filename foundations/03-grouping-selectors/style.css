/*if a number of selectors have same styling but also different and unique styling, we can group the selectors like above, for similar styling in this
case that was the font-size and font-family, then we can go on to style the individual classes, differently where they are unique from each other
as seen above with the background colors being different and the black-button class also having a yellow color whereas the yellow-button class 
has default black text.*/
